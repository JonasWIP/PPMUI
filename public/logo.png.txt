This is a placeholder for the logo.png file.

When implementing the template, you should replace this with an actual logo image file.
You can create a simple logo using any image editing software or use a logo generator.

Recommended logo specifications:
- Format: PNG with transparency
- Size: 32x32 pixels (minimum), 64x64 pixels (recommended)
- Style: Simple, flat design that works well on both light and dark backgrounds

Once you have your logo, rename it to "logo.png" and replace this placeholder file.
