/**
 * Dashboard Page Tests
 * 
 * NOTE: These are currently placeholder tests to ensure CI passes.
 * 
 * FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED:
 * 1. Properly mock the Supabase client and its methods
 * 2. Add tests for loading state
 * 3. Add tests for authenticated state showing the "User Dashboard" title
 * 4. Add tests for error states
 * 5. Add tests for user roles being displayed correctly
 * 
 * The main challenge with testing this component is properly mocking:
 * - The Supabase client (particularly the dynamic import)
 * - The getCurrentUser, getUserProfile and other auth functions
 * - The user roles data structure
